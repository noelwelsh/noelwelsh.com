I'm Noel, but you've worked that out already.

I have a passion for the digital computer, which I see as the most powerful invention of modern times. I am interested in all aspects of computing, with a particular interest in machine learning. The latter led me to get a MSc and PhD in the subject.

I'm a founder of [Myna](http://mynaweb.com/), a product for web content optimisation. Think A/B testing but using modern mathematics. As is the nature of startups, I work on anything and everything the business requires, be it machine learning, marketing, or just answering the phone.

At [Underscore](http://underscoreconsulting.com) I provide consultancy services centered around the [Scala](http://scala-lang.org) language. Our main focus is software architecture and implementation for scalable and performant systems, be it on the web or other.

I live in Birmingham, UK with my wife, two deranged rompasaurs, and a deliquent alley cat.

## About this Blog

This blog is built with [Jekyll bootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/). A previous version was built using Octopress, but I found this too complex.

The theme is one of my own devising, heavily inspired by [Syte](http://rigoneri.github.com/syte/) and [Svbtle](https://svbtle.com/).
