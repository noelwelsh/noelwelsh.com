I'm Noel, but you've worked that out already. I'm [@noelwelsh](http://twitter.com/noelwelsh) on Twitter, and also [noelwelsh](https://github.com/noelwelsh) on Github.

I'm a founder of [Myna](http://mynaweb.com/), a product for web content optimisation. Think A/B testing but using modern mathematics. As is the nature of startups, I work on anything and everything the business requires, be it machine learning, marketing, or just answering the phone.

At [Underscore](http://underscoreconsulting.com) I provide consultancy services centered around the [Scala](http://scala-lang.org) language. Our main focus is software architecture and implementation for scalable and performant systems, be it on the web or other.

I have a PhD in machine learning, and a background in machine learning and software development.

I live in Birmingham, UK with my wife, two deranged rompasaurs, and a delinquent alley cat.

## About this Blog

This blog is built with [Jekyll bootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/). A previous version was built using Octopress, but I found Octopress too complex for my needs.

The theme is one of my own devising, heavily inspired by [Syte](http://rigoneri.github.com/syte/) and [Svbtle](https://svbtle.com/).
