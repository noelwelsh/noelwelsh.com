title: ScalaBridge London Season One
---

[ScalaBridge][scalabridge] aims to increase diversity within the Scala community by providing training in Scala to traditionally under-represented groups. [ScalaBridge London][scalabridge-london] is, as the name suggests, the London chapter of ScalaBridge. A month or so ago we finished the first "season" of ScalaBridge London. Now is a good time to reflect on what we did and how it worked out.

## Background

ScalaBridge London started when I met [Anna Bladzich][annab] at Scala Exchange in 2018. We shared a common interest in increasing diversity within the Scala community, and started talking about ScalaBridge. I'd attended a few ScalaBridge events, which had all been one-off one day workshops, and I thought we needed something longer term if we really wanted to make a significant difference. We decided to try something a bit more permanent in London.

I have to give a huge shout-out to Anna, who did the majority of the organisational work for our first season of ScalaBridge London. It wouldn't have happened without her!


## What We Did

One of the interesting things about ScalaBridge is that the students don't necessarily all share the same goal and they definitely don't all have the same background. Some will already be experienced programmers, whilst some will have never programmed before. Some will want to move into a Scala development role whilst some will just be there for fun. It isn't our place to tell the students what they should get out of ScalaBridge. Instead we wanted to offer the opportunity and let the students make out of it what they desired. That said, we knew a majority would have an interest in commercial development roles, and we know that people need more than technical support, particularly those who don't have an established programming career.

With this in mind we decided to start with six evenings spread over twelve weeks. This makes our first season (though you could call it a semester or term if you prefer). We ended up with about 18 hours in total with the students, of which about 12 was spent programming and remainder on socialising. We wanted to develop a good relationship with the students so when it came to providing the other kinds of support they needed, such as introducing them to prospective employers, they'd be comfortable approaching us. We also know people learn better when they learn with other people and wanted the students to help support each other.

Our venues were provided by Scala employers around London. Most venues were also able to provide food. Huge thanks to the Guardian, iTV, Permutive, Elsevier, Depop, and Thoughtworks for hosting us!

We divided students into three broad groups: those with very little or no programming experience, those who had experience but not with Scala, and those with Scala or other FP experience. Within each broad group we split the students into smaller groups of about 3, who worked with a single mentor.

Our mentors came from the Scala community in London. Finding them was fairly easy as we could leverage our existing network. We discovered we tended to acquire new mentors with each new venue we visited, as the developers there saw how much fun it was!

Finding students was more challenging as we couldn't tap into our existing network. It's also the most important step! We advertisted at:

* London universities;
* diversity focused meetups;
* data science meetups;
* Scala meetups;
* on Twitter;
* on LinkedIn; and
* probably more places I don't remember right now.

As our curriculum we used [Creative Scala][creative-scala] for the beginners, and [Essential Scala][essential-scala] for the non-FP developers. For the Essential Scala group, which was the largest, we also wrote some [lesson plans][lesson-plans]. The advanced developers we left to choose their own path in collaboration with their mentor.

## What We Achieved

Attendence. Difficulties with consistent groups.

Projects didn't really happen.

Student progress.

Mentoring (jobs etc.)
