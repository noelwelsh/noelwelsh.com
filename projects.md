Over time I've managed to do some stuff.

## Myna

[Myna](http://mynaweb.com/) is a next generation A/B testing tool. It's based on bandit algorithms, which provide a neat way of doing hypothesis testing-esque things without some of the problems of said tests.

## Consultancy

I offer consultancy services on data science and programming via [Underscore](//underscoreconsulting.com/) and [Untyped](//untyped.com/).

## Talks

Talks that have featured on this blog include:

<ul>
{% assign pages_list = site.tags.talk %}
{% include JB/pages_list %}
</ul>

## Books

I sometimes pretend to be writing a [book](http://noelwelsh.com/blueeyes/index.html) about the BlueEyes REST service framework.

## Open Source

I contribute to a number of open-source projects. Most of my personal project are on [my Github account](https://github.com/noelwelsh). I'm a committer to the [BlueEyes](http://github.com/jdegoes/blueeeys) Scala REST framework, and to [Racket](https://github.com/plt/racket), a fine LISP descendant. [Bigtop](https://github.com/bigtop) is our utility library built on BlueEyes. Some other projects can be found on [Untyped's](http://github.com/untyped) page.
