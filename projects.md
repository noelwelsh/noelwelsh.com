# Projects

## Work
I've founded a few companies:

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.inner-product.com/">Inner Product</a> is a consultancy focused on Scala, primarily serving the US.</li>
<li><a href="https://underscore.io/">Underscore</a> is a consultancy focused on Scala, primarily serving the UK.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.mynaweb.com/">Myna</a> was an A/B testing SaaS. Our core innovation was using bandit algorithms to make more efficient use of data.</li>
<li><a href="https://untyped.com/">Untyped</a> is a consultancy founded by my friend Dave and I. Untyped doesn't currently do much work directly, but it's involved in other projects.</li>
</ul>


## Community

I'm one of the organizers for [ScalaBridge London](https://www.scalabridgelondon.org/), which aims to increase diversity within the Scala community.


## Books

<dl>
<dt><a href="https://creativescala.org/">Creative Scala</a></dt>
<dd>An introduction to functional programming and generative art, aimed at people new to programming. Creative Scala is heavily inspired by <a href="https://htdp.org/">HtDP</a>, and like HtDP strives to present programming as a systematic process.</dd>
<dt><a href="https://underscore.io/books/essential-scala/">Essential Scala</a></dt>
<dd>An introduction to Scala for experienced developers, Essential Scala revolves around four core techniques in effective Scala programming: algebraic data types, structural recursion, sequencing computations, and type classes.</dd>
<dt><a href="https://underscore.io/books/scala-with-cats/">Scala with Cats</a></dt>
<dd>This book covers core functional programming abstractions such as monoids and monads, and shows how they can be used in the small and in the large.</dd>

## Code

At the moment my main open source project is <a href="https://github.com/creative-scala/doodle">Doodle</a>, a Scala library for visualisation and creative coding. Other projects can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/noelwelsh/">Github account</a>.
