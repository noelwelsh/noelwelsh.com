Here are the some of the projects I'm currently working on, or have worked on in the past.

## Books

I'm crazy enough to be writing a [book](http://noelwelsh.com/blueeyes/index.html) about the BlueEyes REST service framework.

## Open Source

I contribute to a number of open-source projects. Most of my personal project are on [my Github account](https://github.com/noelwelsh). I'm a committer to the [BlueEyes](http://github.com/jdegoes/blueeeys) Scala REST framework, and to [Racket](https://github.com/plt/racket), a fine LISP descendant. [Bigtop](https://github.com/bigtop) is our utility library built on BlueEyes. A few other projects can be found on [Untyped's](http://github.com/untyped) page.


## Commercial

Right now, my main projects are [Myna](http://mynaweb.com/) and my ever-changing consultancy jobs.
