# The Books

I have written three books:

1. [Creative Scala](https://creativescala.org/creative-scala), which is aimed at people completely new to programming;
2. [Essential Scala](https://underscore.io/books/essential-scala/), which is aimed at professional developers who are new to Scala; and
3. [Scala with Cats](https://www.scalawithcats.com/), which is about building systems using Cats.

The plan is to end up with two vastly better books using Scala 3. 
For now I'm using "Creative Scala" and "Scala with Cats" as the names for these books, but that might change as the books near completion.
