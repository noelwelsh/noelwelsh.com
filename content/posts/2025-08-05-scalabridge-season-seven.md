title = "ScalaBridge Season Seven"
+++

We recently wrapped up season six of ScalaBridge, with a [review] of the past
season, and a discussion of what we want to see next year. To be honest,
entering the review I wasn't feeling optimistic about ScalaBridge's future. In
the two years since resuming, I feel we haven't found a structure that really
works. Partly this is the environment we're in; everything is harder now than it
was before COVID. However, I still feel we're failing to deliver what the people
want, which is most clearly reflected in our high dropout rate. I left the
review in a completely different mood, excited for the future. In this post I'm
talking about the changes that we're looking to implement, and how we're going
to do it. I've distilled the feedback into three interconnected themes,
content, community, and connection, which I discuss below.

## Content

A consistent request was for better content to work on, specifically more
clarity on what people will be doing and learning and projects that let people
create something they can feel proud of and show to others.

Our existing material is variable quality. I think [Creative
Scala][creative-scala] is pretty good, but it's aimed a true beginners who
aren't ready to take on a full project. Everything else is, I think, not where
we want it to be. For the future we're going to develop a bunch of small projects
that:

- are very clear on the learning goals;
- finish having created something tangible;
- are open-ended for those who want to explore further;
- cover a range of different skill levels; and
- cover a range of different domains.

Creating this content is going to be a lot of work, so our plan is to use the
first semester back to do it.


## Community

People wanted to feel more of a sense of community. They want to work with other
people to build fun and inspiring stuff, and they want to feel the same about
ScalaBridge. There are few ways we'll make that happen.

Firstly, we've long claimed that ScalaBridge is a community-run organisation.
We're going to make that more of a reality in season seven by delegating much
more of the organisation. This one is on me, and I've already taken steps to
start the process.

We're going to be much clearer on groups and attendance, which will be helped by
the work we're doing on content. We'll continue to start each semester by
assigning groups, and we'll ask those groups to decide on attendance schedule
and nominate a leader who will be responsible for chasing everyone.

Since we are all working on projects, we'll spend more time at the end of each
semester showing each other what we've built and celebrating our achievements. 

Finally, we'll run more purely social events.


## Connection

Finally, we want more connection to others outside ScalaBridge. A few ways will
try to achieve this:

- we'll use social media to show what we have created, not just announce events;
- we'll try to connect to other communities that might be interested in what
  we're doing; and
- we are tentatively planning a summer time conference as a showcase and
  celebration, and way to engage with the wider community.


## Meeting Schedule

One big open question is the frequency and venue for meetings. We've been
meeting every 2 weeks, alternating between online and in-person and with 12 week
semesters. I want to discuss possibilities for changing this. We could drop down
to once a month meetings, or meet every week for, say, a 6 week semester. I'm
also not sure how much value our online meetings have. Its much harder to bring
the vibes online, but they do allow people to attend who would not otherwise be
able to come.


## Next Steps

Planning is easy; implementation is what counts. Most of the details will be worked out on our [Discord][discord], so make sure you drop in there if you want to contribute.
