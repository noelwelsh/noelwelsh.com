[ScalaBridge London](https://www.scalabridgelondon.org/) is a community for people who are underrepresented in technology to learn Scala. We last met in 2020, stopping when COVID made it impossible to continue. I want to restart ScalaBridge London, with a few differences laid out below.

## The Plan

We will continue to meet once every two weeks, but I'd like to alternate between in-person and online events. In-person has a lot of benefits, but online is more accessible and less effort to arrange.

It is a lot of work to deliver quality sessions. I've spent a substantial amount of time reworking existing material and developing new material, but this is only part of the problem. Giving mentors the support they need to deliver that material is a substantial task, and my inability to do this in the online setting is the main reason I decided to pause the group. I want to address this in one or both of the following ways:

1. Keep the initial student group small, so I can teach everyone. (This means the initial group must all be around about the same level of expertise, or divide into at least two groups.) Develop support material as we go so that the next iteration is ready for a larger cohort.

2. A number of people have expressed interest in helping out with teaching, so put in the effort up-front to train them and support a larger cohort of students with mixed abilities.

Talks. Other support.

Whatever we do has to work for everyone involved, so anything here is subject to change if something else works better for the group.
