# The Epistemology of Handstands

I'm certain that at some point in your life you've vomited. Head over the toilet bowl, gasping for air, may be a strange time to think about epistemology---the study of knowledge---but there's something quite interesting going on here. Clearly you know how to vomit---the evidence is in front of you---but you also you don't. You---all of you---knows how to vomit, but the portion of you that is your consciousness is merely an observer to the act. Your consciousness is informed that you're going vomit, and gets to experience the unpleasant act, but doesn't have any control over the decision to vomit or the actual process of vomiting. I understand giving birth is similar, and a lot of bodily functions are partly or fully under unconscious control. For example, respiration and heart rate are usually managed unconsciously, and I'm not aware we have any conscious control over pupil dilation.

You might say there is not real knowledge involved in vomiting. It's just something that happens when the reflex is triggered, in the same way an LED emits light when it receives sufficient current. Leaving aside issues of free will, this is a reasonable argument, so lets move to a different example.

You almost certainly have hands, and with those hands you can üëç, ü§ò, üññ, and more. How do you do this? You just think of the shape and the hands do it. There is conscious control over the decision of the shape to make with the hands, but not over the process that produces that shape. 

Moving hands is definitely a learned skill. If you've been around a young baby you might have seen them lying on their back, waving around the hands, and occasionally succeeding in stuffing them into their mouth. Eventually the baby will get a bit more control over its hands and start to use the simple guestures that are characterisitc of babies: pointing with the thumb extended, grasping with a fully clenched fist and so on. Eventually the baby will learn to move its body. From now on nothing---not the cat, not the biscuit barrel, and certainly not the baby---will be safe.

We don't have memories from earlier than about two years, so you might argue that
