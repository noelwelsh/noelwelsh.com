title = "An Introduction to Programming Strategies"

Programming is a largely systematic activity. There are strategies that, in the majority of cases, allow us to move from problem to working code using a sequence of repeatable steps. Code written in this way is of high quality. It is fast to write and easy to read, because it follows familiar patterns. It is more likely to work, because the strategies come with certain guarantees about correctness. It is overall a more effective way to program.

The strategies come from statically typed functional programming (FP). They can be made to work in any language but they are harder to implement without language support, and correctness guarantees rely on the formal model that underpins functional programming.

It's taken me about a decade to fully realize these strategies. I was introduced to this idea by [How to Design Programs][htdp] (HtDP). I've since extended the ideas in HtDP to cover more of the cases I've encountered in practice. I now find by far the majority of my coding is covered by a strategy.


## Programming Strategies

A programming strategy is ... **TODO**

Strategies exist above the code. The code is a realization of a particular strategy, but the strategy is more general than the code is creates. This means strategies generalize across languages. It also means that they are not concerned with the details of a particular language. However these details are an important part of the craft of using a language proficiently!
