# Review: Racket Programming the Fun Way

No Starch Press sent me a review copy of "Racket Programming the Fun Way". No money changed hands.

RPtFW starts with a *very* fast introduction to the language. I don't think it's sufficient to learn the language from---perhaps if you're already an experienced developer---but I think Racket already has very strong introductory material. I can understand not wanting to get bogged down in true beginner material. I think a reference to some of the introductory material might have improved this section. Newcomers to the language might not realise just how much is available in the [Racket documentation][racket-docs].

The good stuff starts about halfway through Chapter 3, with some discussion of the Towers of Hanoi, the properties of the Fibonacci sequence, and an interesting puzzle called "the Insurance Salesman Problem".
