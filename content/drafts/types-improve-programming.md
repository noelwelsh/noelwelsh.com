title = "Types Improve Programming"

In certain circles of the Internet it is accepted to say statements like "there's no empirical evidence that static types reduce bugs". I believe this:

- rests on an ill-posed premise;
- misrepresents the available evidence; and
- is bad communication of science. 

Let's go.

When I see these statements they usual refer back to [this literature review][dan-luu] by Dan Luu.


## An Ill-Posed Question

If we are going to make statements about

## Asking the Right Question

To assess the evidence we first need to be clear what we're looking for. 
Not all type systems are equal.


## Assessing the Evidence

Not all studies will provide equally useful evidence.
