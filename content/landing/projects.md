Some of my projects are pulled out in the [code](/landing/code) and [books](/landing/books) pages. 

In the day job at [Inner Product](https://inner-product.com/) I help companies achieve success with Scala and functional programming. This may mean delivering features, training developers, reviewing architecture&mdash;anything that can help the project achieve success!

My other large professional project is [ScalaBridge
London](https://www.scalabridgelondon.org/). ScalaBridge's goal is to increase
diversity within the Scala community. We attempt to do this by offering free
training and support to those currently under-represented. ScalaBridge brings
together many of the other things I've worked on; we use [Creative
Scala](/landing/books) and [Doodle](/landing/code) as an introduction to
programming, for example.
