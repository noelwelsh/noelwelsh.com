At the moment most of my coding is in [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/). I've written a lot of [Racket](https://racket-lang.org/), and Java, and smaller amounts of C, Python, Ruby, Matlab, shell script, and other languagues going back to Basic on the [VIC-20](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_VIC-20).


I run an open source organization called [Creative Scala](https://github.com/creativescala/). Here are some of the projects it develops:

- [Doodle](https://www.creativescala.org/doodle/) is a Scala library for compositional 2D graphics, with an emphasis on the creative computing aspects.
- [Chartreuse](https://github.com/creativescala/chartreuse) is a data visualization library built on top of Doodle.
- [Terminus](https://github.com/creativescala/terminus/) is a library for terminal interaction that runs on the JVM, Javascript, and native code.


Other code can be found on my [personal Github](https://github.com/noelwelsh/). Some of my favourite projects are:

- a [todo list application](https://github.com/scalabridgelondon/todone/) using [Scala.js](http://www.scala-js.org/) and React;
- an [implementation](https://github.com/noelwelsh/pfennig) of a probabilistic programming language; 
- [some fun examples using Doodle](https://github.com/noelwelsh/sketches);
- [this website](https://github.com/noelwelsh/noelwelsh.com) using [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/); and
- an incomplete [ia32 assembler in Racket](https://github.com/noelwelsh/assembler).
