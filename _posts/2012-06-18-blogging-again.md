I set up this site some time ago, but never got around to publishing it. The reason was simple: I started with Octopress but found it too difficult to customise the style of my liking. So the site just sat around gathering digital dust.

In the meantime I became more familiar with both Jekyll and Bootstrap, and Jekyll Bootstrap was released. Perfect! The importance of blogging is also becoming more apparent as we attempt to build up [Myna](http://mynaweb.com/). It's true that much conversation has shifted to Twitter, HN, and the like, but blogs are still the source of material that drives the conversation.

So here we are.
