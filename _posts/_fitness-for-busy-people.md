This post is about attaining or maintaining a good level of fitness without using a lot of time and money. It comes from my own experience. After 20 years of general gym rattery, my regular workouts were brought to a halt by the arrival of two children and the decision to found a company. Suddenly, finding the time to get to the gym was difficult, and it was hard to justify the expense given my increasing outgoing and meagre income. I wanted to maintain (or even improve) my fitness, and so far I've been able to. If you're in a similar situation, where you don't have the time to get to a gym and can't equip your home with a lot of workout equipment, I hope this post will work for you too.

Nothing here is new. All I've done in collected ideas from a variety of sources, and mixed them together into something that works for me. There is no magic to working out, and there never will be.

I don't want to make this post too large by covering material already freely available elsewhere, so for details in some sections I link to other sites. I've included a section of Resources at the end that will give more information on various topics.

## Goals

As stated above, the primary goal is to teach you how to workout effectively on limited time and money. As such I will mostly focus on movements that use your own body weight, perhaps augmented with a few inexpensive accessories. If you can access free weights they will enhance your workouts but I'm not going to discuss them much here.

In my definition of fitness there are three main attributes: strength, mobility, and endurance. It is common to equate fitness solely with endurance: if you can run 10 miles to my 5, you're fitter than me. I don't follow this belief. In fact I believe strength is the primary attribute that should be developed.

Strong people look better naked, and muscle makes weight maintenance easier as muscle uses more energy than fat. Vanity aside, strength training has numerous benefits when we consider the long game. Many of the effects of aging, such [muscle atrophy](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18347672) and [decreasing bone density](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19453205) can be countered by strength training and it's this that will keep you out of a nursing home as you age. As strength is [associated](http://www.bmj.com/content/345/bmj.e7279) with [longer life](http://www.bmj.com/content/337/bmj.a439.full) you can look forward to more great years as you get stronger.

Attaining the endurance required for most team sports is relatively easy, and this level of endurance also brings all the health benefits associated with a "healthy heart". Participating in pure endurance sports like marathons or long-distance cycling requires time consuming training, harms other aspects of fitness, and can be a costly endeavour. For these reasons I don't consider this type of training.

Mobility is an essential

## Overview

Here's the essentials of what I suggest:

- Bodyweight movements will be the mainstay of your workouts. You will require no special equipment except possibly an inexpensive pull-up bar or gymnastics rings, and some shoes. They are time efficient as they work large amounts of muscle mass at once, and can be scaled down to the most basic beginner or up to the Olympic contender.
- At a minimum, you can fit most of your training into short bursts done during the day, supplemented with two to four twenty minute sessions for more intense activity.
- Eat a sensible diet.
- Play with movement. Enjoy using your body. If you have kids, throw them into the air (just catch them on the way down, ok?)
- Enjoy the journey. It will last a lifetime.


## Movements

Movement is that foundation of any exercise program. Indeed movement is all that exercise really is. Here we'll look at the basic movements and how to combine that into workouts.

### Basic Movements

I divide movements into three groups of two pairs:

- Vertical upper body pull and push. The pull-up and the [handstand push-up](http://www.beastskills.com/handstand-pushups-beginner/) are the classic bodyweight vertical pull and push movements respectively.
- Horizontal upper body pull and push. You probably know the push-up, which is a fundamental horizontal push. The [planche](http://www.dragondoor.com/articles/building-an-olympic-body-through-bodyweight-conditioning/default.aspx) is another horizontal push that will give you a greater challenge. The [front lever](http://www.dragondoor.com/articles/building-an-olympic-body-through-bodyweight-conditioning/default.aspx) is the corresponding pull, with the [body row](http://www.exrx.net/WeightExercises/BackGeneral/BWSupineRow.html) providing a basic entry point if the front lever progressions are too hard.
- Lower body pull and push. The [squat](http://www.exrx.net/WeightExercises/Quadriceps/BBSquat.html) and [deadlift](http://www.exrx.net/WeightExercises/GluteusMaximus/BBDeadlift.html) are the paradigmatic lower body push and pull respectively. Bodyweight movements tend to be less effective for lower body strength development then their barbell cousins, but there are still some great options. [One-legged squats](http://www.beastskills.com/one-legged-squat-the-pistol/) are the good push exercise, as is jumping. Sprinting is an excellent lower body pulling exercise, as is the [shrimp squat](http://idoportal.blogspot.co.uk/2009/08/explosive-leg-workout.html), and the [bodyweight hamstring curl](http://rosstraining.com/blog/2009/02/14/homemade-hamstring-training/) (requires a bit of equipment).

A push is a movement that primarily uses the muscles on the front of your body. A pull primarily uses the muscles on the back of your body.

You should aim for balance in your workouts. Over a week or two you should work each pair equally, and upper and lower body equally.


### Rep Ranges

- Reps and Sets
-- Strength
-- Hypertrophy
-- Endurance
- Training History

### Scaling

- Increasing Leverage
- Using Fewer limbs

### Equipment

- Rings
- Pullup bar
- Dumbbells
- Children

## Process

When routine goes out the window you need to be flexible. I use a few different strategies which I apply as the situation allows.

### Intermittent Sets

If I'm at home with the kids I know I'm not going to get a solid block of time to workout. Instead I will pick an exercise without a large skill or space requirement, and which hits a muscle group I haven't used recently, and just knock out sets of it whenever I get a chance. Over the course of a day I might get five or ten sets in. For example, if I choose pullups I'll hang the pullup bar up and do a set of ten (or perhaps fewer reps at a harder variant) every time I pass it. I normally do a set or two of lower reps to warmup.

I find this works best with relatively higher repetitions.

### Single Focus Workout

If I can grab ten to twenty minutes I'll hit a single movement. I usually work up to a difficult or heavy movement, and then drop back to an easier movement that works the same muscles to get some volume.

For example, if I had decided to work on vertical pulling I might decide to do assisted one-hand pullups for perhaps five sets of three, then knock out three sets of close to maximum reps of normal pullups.

There is no particular magic to this. I just like being able to hit a variety of different strength modalities (limit strength, strength endurance) in a single workout so I feel I covered that movement if I don't get back to it for a week.

### Full Workout

If I can grab 40-60 minutes I do a full workout, typically working lower body, and an upper body push and pull. I normally focus on harder movements here, and I have the time to rest between sets and gather the physical and mental energy for taxing work.

### Periodization

People who are training seriously vary their training load over time, a process known as periodization. I use a method called "random periodization". It works like this:

- If I'm reasonably well rested and not sore from previous workouts, I workout.
- Life schedules regular rest days when I travel or the kids decide not to sleep.

Simple!
