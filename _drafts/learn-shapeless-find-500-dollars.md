I spent a few hours learning [Shapeless](https://github.com/milessabin/shapeless) and it made me $500.

At ScalaDays (http://www.originate.com/stories/scala-days-2014) The task is to implement a simple stack-based (or concatenative) language.

I had read about stack-based languages [Forth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth_%28programming_language%29) and [Joy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joy_%28programming_language%29) in the halcyon days of [Lambda the Ultimate](http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/) but I'd never actually used one, so this competition looked like a good way of learning some about how they worked. I also thought I could



All up I think this is a great contest. It was very easy to get a basic solution implemented, but it had infinite depth to create a more extensions.
