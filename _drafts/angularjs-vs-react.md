[AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) and [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/index.html) are two of the most prominent Javascript UI frameworks available today. It is natural to ask which is best. Having some experience my opinion is React, by a landslide.

I'll get into why in a moment, but first some background. I'm not very experienced with either framework. I've spent about three days with React, and slightly longer with AngularJS. I recently needed to get up to speed with a moderate size AngularJS project. I had trouble understanding the code organisation and decided to rewrite part of it in React, giving me the opportunity to learn React and the code structure at the same time.

With that out of the way, on to my comparison.

## Simplicity

My number one reason for preferring React to AngularJS is its simplicity. In React there are three concepts: *components* with *properties* and *state*. Components are just code. Writing React is just writing code. And because there is so little to React, when I wanted to learn it I could read all the documentation in just one day.

In contrast AngularJS has an explosion of new concepts. There are, at least, *controllers*, *directives*, *factories*, *scopes*, *services*, the directives library, the module system, the dependency injection system, and quite possibly more I don't even know about yet. Add to that the famously bad documentation.
